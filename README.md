# wave-function-collapse

This is an implementation of the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) generative algorithm on images for a Power Point Presentation Party where I presented.

The algorithm was explained, a series of images representing the generated image as the algorithm executed was provided, and I showed a timelapse of the work done on the project and presentation over the three days or so.
